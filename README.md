# Extraction Methods of Handwritten Digit Recognition Tested on the USPS Database
Handwritten digit recognition has recently been of
very interest among the researchers because of the evolution of
various Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision
algorithms , this paper deals with an handwritten digit recognition
system and a method of extraction of characteristics based on the
digit form, this method is tested on the USPS handwritten isolated
digit database (20000 images in learning and 1500 images in test).
In this report, I compare the results of some of the most widely
used Machine Learning Algorithms like SVM, KNN, PCA, LDA,
QDA, LRC, MLP, ABC, DTC, HOG + SVM, Bayesian, SGD &
RFC this work has achieved approximately 80% of success rate
for USPS database identification.


Our model works in three steps: 1) Preprocessing, 2) Features
extraction and 3)Use classification Method. In the
preprocessing, we have some basic image processing to
separate numbers from real samples or preparing data from
dataset (which is reshaped from images to the vectors) and then
in the second part, we extract features which is very distinguishable descriptor for digits recognition where we
divide an input image into fixed 28*28 cells and we represent
each digit with a vector of features. The summary of several
classification methods that used in this paper are: QDA that is
a classifier with a quadratic decision boundary, generated by
fitting class conditional densities to the data and using Bayesâ€™
rule, RFC is a random forest is a meta estimator that fits a
number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of
the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive
accuracy and control over-fitting, DTC is a Decision Tree
Classifier, repetitively divides the working area(plot) into sub
part by identifying lines. repetitively because there may be two
distant regions of same class divided by other, MLP is a Multilayer Perceptron classifier, this model optimizes the log-loss
function using LBFGS or stochastic gradient descent and SVM
a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier
formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words,
given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm
outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new
examples.

Digit recognition on the USPS dataset involves training a machine learning model to accurately classify handwritten digits. The USPS dataset consists of images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

Here's a step-by-step guide to performing digit recognition on the USPS dataset in Python:

Import the required libraries:


```bash
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Load the USPS dataset using the fetch_openml function from scikit-learn:

```

Load the USPS dataset using the fetch_openml function from scikit-learn:

```bash
usps = fetch_openml('usps', version=2)
Preprocess the data:
Separate the features (pixel values) and targets (digit labels):

```

```bash
X = usps.data.astype('float64')
y = usps.target.astype('int64')
Split the data into training and testing sets:

```

```bash
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1:

```

```bash
X_train /= 255.0
X_test /= 255.0
Train a machine learning model on the training data. In this example, we'll use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier:
python
```

```bash
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=10)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Evaluate the model's performance on the test data:
```

```bash
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
Visualize a few example predictions:
```


```bash
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3, figsize=(8, 8))
for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):
    ax.imshow(X_test[i].reshape(16, 16), cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title(f"True: {y_test[i]}, Pred: {y_pred[i]}")
    ax.axis('off')
plt.show()
```


This is a basic example of how to perform digit recognition on the USPS dataset using Python. You can explore different classifiers and experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of the model.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
